Mass-gravity rule (understanding) may be over

Rotational speed of earth may be definer of distance to sun. Both stable.

Adding radius and mass, entire galaxy can be an equation, resulting zero, since balanced.

It keeps rotating
and
Can not get closer because it is fast
Can not move away because its slow

Ellipsis imbalance, may be due to some other reason
