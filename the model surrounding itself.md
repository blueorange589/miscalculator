building a culture mainly runs on media but can be run within society as well.

cancel culture, hate culture is to give some examples.

one of most prominent example is to focus on others and their mistakes rather than self.

what is being done is to overwrite year by year, until people don't remember old themselves. rest runs on auto-pilot. people think (quite hard to reverse), this is me, this is life.

so the crew can sail to new horizons.
