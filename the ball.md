All life takes place on a ball that turns non-stop.

At this place, everyone's focused on their journey and can't help others even on most prosperous day.

The will, gets place above everything else to survive, to impact, to realize the life.

Probably many observed, a dog or a bear can not go further whn cat is reacting. So life checks if you are still alive or just breathing.

Probably they know, one looks alive, may be their end as well.

Life requires some minimum amount of will, rather than being traded for non-life things.
