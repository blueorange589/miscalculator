biggest issue for human life. same carpet, same events, same return 

its possible to break out locally by breaking daily routines or sudden changes to daily plans. however it gets stuck to return again due to outer circle after reaching maximum.

i wish life flows in a way (for everyone) that i can change my life in a day, leaving all house and belongins behind, that i run away from them.
