biggest issue for human life. same carpet, same events, same return after some time.

its possible to break out locally by breaking daily routines or sudden changes to daily plans. however it gets stuck to return again due to outer circle after reaching maximum.

i wish life flows in a way (for everyone) that i can change my life in a day, leaving all house and belongins behind, that i run away from them.


difficult process of making an application, meetings, tests, paperwork is blocking people, not to mention burden called CV. My objective? make money. what else can be?
I think saxophone is nice as a saxophone, not on objectives section of a CV.

no ones happy to lose time in wrong place for them.
