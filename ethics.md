this has ruined your life and the world.

coupled with duality from india. tht it creates and live with its opposite.

the demand for ethics is unethical, so paradoxal.

is putting the other person into "have to" state, forcing to obey.

a should, a must, an ought is a "have to", not only in aviation, but in daily life as well.

i only evaluate on "dirty, ugly, low-quality", not on ethics. I don't expect ethics, even from my enemy.

the way to get rid of ethics is not to expect/demand it from others.

it wasn't ethics (others rule), thats stopping you and others from doing what they don't do.
