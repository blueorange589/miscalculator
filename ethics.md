this has ruined your life and the world.

coupled with duality from india. that it creates and live with its opposite.

the demand for ethics is unethical, so paradoxal.

is putting the other person into "have to" state, forcing to obey.

a should, a must, an ought is a "have to", not only in aviation, but in daily life as well.

i only evaluate on "dirty, ugly, low-quality", not on ethics. I don't expect ethics, even from my enemy.

the way to get rid of ethics is not to expect/demand it from others.

it wasn't ethics (others rule), thats stopping you and others from doing what they don't do.

if one gets punished due to ethics, everything else around has to be perfect. otherwise it is unfair, so again un-ethical.

is an enemy of freedom and independence, is an intervener to duty of security and law forces, with no seat you can apply with objection.

with its bi-products all racist, full of hate and horror... by the start, through the end, ethics is biggest threat to societies and the life.

-----
solving a paradox
invalidation of hypotesis

that would make everything (you can imagine) is ethical, including unethical approach of ethics.

therefore, ethically nothing wrong with racing for front seats

ethically nothing wrong with disobeying the queue (why lose time? solution is different)

ethically nothing wrong with the war (except than logical part)

Nothing wrong with anything, its all ethical
